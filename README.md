# rust-efi-types
Autogenerated Rust bindings for UEFI types and methods.

Generated using `bindgen` from the headers distributed with gnu-efi. The headers are included.
Only works on x86_64, and I don't plan to extend it to other platforms, or clean it up in any way,
because it's all just a giant hack so that I don't have to waste much time on proper bindings
at this moment. Eventually, it will outlive its usefullness and be unceremoniously dumped into trash.
